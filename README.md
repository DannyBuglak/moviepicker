# moviepicker
If you ever can't think of a movie to watch, use this to randomly give you choices.

## Inspiration
This is my first personal project that implements APIs. I wanted to challenge myself and force myself to find the API myself and begin from scratch.

# Citation
The public API used was requested from: https://www.themoviedb.org

I use this API to find movies based off what the user selects on the front end.
